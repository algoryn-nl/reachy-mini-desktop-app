## 🚀 Release v0.8.4

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Automatic mjpython Shebang Correction on macOS (#45)
Fixed simulation mode crash on macOS caused by incorrect mjpython shebang. The uv-trampoline sidecar now automatically detects and fixes the shebang at every daemon startup.

**Details:**
- Detects shebangs containing `binaries/.venv` or `binaries/cpython` paths
- Automatically replaces with correct path to `target/debug/.venv/bin/python3`
- Handles both absolute and relative paths
- No manual intervention required

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates simulation mode crashes on macOS
- ✅ Automatic fix at each daemon startup
- ✅ Compatible with any mujoco version
